Happy Feet ðŸ¤–ðŸ’ƒ
===============================
During exam season or any stressful period, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Happy Feet was created to be a small yet lively companion, offering breaks that help lift spirits and promote positivity. Imagine a robot that not only dances with you but also brings a smile to your face, even if just for a moment. Happy Feet embodies these little moments of joy, keeping you motivated and helping you stay sane.

## Features
Fun Dances: Performs a variety of dance moves, including the classic "stanky leg."
Easy-to-Use: Simple setup that brings a joyful distraction when you need it most.
Expandable: Designed with future enhancements in mind, like adding music, voice chat, and mood-based features.

## Technology
Happy Feet is built on an Arduino Uno platform and uses servos to bring it to life. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of the core setup:

Hardware: 4 servos are used (2 for each thigh and 2 for each foot), mounted onto a cardboard platform.
Power Supply: Servos and other components are connected through a breadboard to a reliable power source.
Programming: The robotâ€™s dance moves are programmed using Arduino code and C++, setting up specific angles for the servos to create fun and dynamic movements.

## Initial Prototype

Problems: the bread board made the top of the robot too heavy so we had to find a way to connect all of the hardware without throwing the robot off balance.

## Challenges & Solutions
During development, we encountered several challenges:

Servo Orientation: Some servos were misaligned, requiring recalibration to ensure smooth movement.
Hot Glue Limitations: The glue we used initially restricted servo movement; we later reattached components more carefully.
IR Sensor Issues: We aimed to control Happy Feet with an IR remote, but inconsistent sensor values made it unreliable. A dead remote battery cut our testing short, so we pivoted to manual control.
